There could be a few reasons why you're encountering this error even though you have already installed selenium:

1. Incorrect Python Interpreter: Make sure you are using the correct Python interpreter that has selenium installed. You can check this by opening the Command Palette (CTRL + Shift + P) in Visual Studio Code and typing ‘Python: Select Interpreter’.
2. Incorrect Path: If you have installed selenium in a different location, you need to add the path to your environment variables in Windows.
3. Virtual Environment: If you have installed selenium in a virtual environment, make sure you are running the code from within the virtual environment.
4. Missing Package: You can try reinstalling selenium to ensure that all required packages are installed.
If none of these solutions work, try uninstalling and reinstalling selenium using pip install selenium in the terminal.

You can reinstall selenium using pip in the terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux) by following these steps:

1. Open the terminal and type the following command:
"pip uninstall selenium"
2. Once the uninstallation is complete, type the following command to install selenium again:
"pip install selenium"
3. Wait for the installation to complete and then restart Visual Studio Code.
4. In your code, add the following import statement at the beginning of your script:
import selenium
5. Now try running your code again and see if the "no module found selenium error" still persists. If not, then the problem should have been resolved.
